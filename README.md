Challenge Overview

Your task is to build a simple, clean, responsive mini dashboard UI that includes:

    A top navigation bar with a search input and profile avatar

    A collapsible sidebar with menu items

    A grid of user cards

    A “View” button that opens a modal or drawer with static user details

This challenge is intentionally simple and focused on layout, styling, responsiveness, and component structure.

You may use any frontend framework you’re comfortable with (React preferred).
